Model Refinement for Mark-Recapture Miscellany in R. 

This repository is home to various adaptations of the mrmr R package (https://github.com/SNARL1/mrmr). 
Mrmr, developed by Maxwell B Joseph, automates data processing steps for the analysis of robust design capture-mark-recapture data and fits a Jolly-Seber CMR model implemented in a Bayesian statistical framework.
The model is designed particularly for the needs of the Mountain Lakes Research Group (MLRG), and should not be used as a general purpose mark-recapture modeling toolbox. 

For my masters thesis at Yale School of the Environment, I am working with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) and MLRG to analyze and publish the demographics and dynamics of a CDFW-managed population of the endangered Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog. I'm tinkering with mrmr to beter suit my project needs, and to learn about Bayesian mark-recapture modeling more generally. 

The data I use to run my models is sourced from MLRG, and publically available in their cmr-analysis GitHub repository (https://github.com/SNARL1/cmr-analysis).
